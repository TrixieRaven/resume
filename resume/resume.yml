      position: "Competence Center Lead, DevOps Architect"
      summary: |
        My main function is to lead a DevOps competence center. Not just to show off all the hip and trendy tooling, but also to shift the mindset to a more continuous workflow and to push people to take co-ownership and responsability in a project.
        But ofcourse you cannot say DevOps without showing off some tooling and showing how you can make your life easier and fail/fool-proof by automating even the most insignificant task. By looking at each task from a service perspective, we aim to get more continuity and stability to the work we deliver.

      summary: |
        My job here was 2-facetted. Partly it was archectural designs and getting the technical part rolling and automated as coaching colleagues and customers to undergoing a digital transformation in a DevOps way.
        The Technical part was split up in 2 parts. A part of it, I sat in a true development environment where the focus was to push out new content as fast and stable as possible. Priority here was pipeline optimization, ease to configure and adapt new services and pipelines on a kubernetes environment and bringing some power to the developers. We want to enable them to do everything required, with easy to use tooling and an abstraction layer they feel comfortable using.
        The other part was in an operations team that mainly functioned as-a-service and maintained and managed the infrastructure for all kinds of development teams within Cegeka in an Infrastructure-as-Code fashion.

      summary: |
        We had to migrate from our old infrasructure to our new infrastructure. The baseline here was to get it fully automated and stable, as we were responsible for the management of the whole stack. From maintaining firmware upgrades for the hardware to deploying the artifacts coming from our development teams. We had to constantly test our durability and needed to maintain a 96% uptime on our production environment. This is why we automated the full chain which we constantly stress-tested. This way we could have a decent view of wher our current bottlenecks are and how we could even further improve this.
